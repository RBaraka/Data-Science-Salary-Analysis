            <ul>
                <li>The geographical map was not as intuitive as I hoped; requires more data points globally.</li>
                <li>The map needed a select feature to allow users to zoom in on specific areas of the map where countries are close together.</li>
                <li>The job demand growth graph had a lot of whitespace.</li>
                <li>Living expenses and cost of living play a role in comparing salaries from different countries, this could be added to the dashboard.(suggested by 1 user in the follow-up questionnaire, I didn't have enough time to implement)</li>

                <li>Salary ranges are plateauing since last year.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>There has been consistent job postings growth from 2020 to 2024 which indicated that the field is growing and new.</li>
                <li>2025 only shows a slight increase in job demand; however, the year is not over yet and there may be more job postings.</li>

            <div class="note">
                <strong>Note:</strong> The insights above were seen from exploring data from 2020 to 2025. however, i believe there should be more data points globally than the data collected above. each country with different languages may have other job postings websites that were not taken into account. The data above is insightful, but in my opinion, not comprehensive.
